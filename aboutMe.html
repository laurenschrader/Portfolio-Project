    <h2>A Little Bit About Me..</h2>
    <p>I have a career background in sales and retail management. I spent about seven years in retail- five of which
        were spent working for Nordstrom. I began at Nordstrom as a sales associate, and quickly realized how much I
        enjoyed the dynamic, creative, and often fast-paced nature of working retail.
        <br>
        <br>
        At Nordstrom, I moved up into various management positions where I developed my leadership, organization,
        and problem-solving skills. Retail management was an especially fun space to work in, as every day presented
        new & interesting challenges to tackle. Needless to say, I quickly developed the skills needed to navigate
        that sort of fast-paced & dynamic work environment. In short, my time with Nordstrom gave me the opportunity
        & skills necessary to manage a team, handle logistics, & effectively tackle the always-evolving challenges
        of a retail space.

        Before ever moving into my retail career, I did complete some college education. However at the time, I
        wasn’t quite clear on which path I wanted to take. It was towards the end of my retail career that I began
        exploring an interest in computer science. I had watched 2 of my brothers successfully complete Epicodus &
        shortly after, they moved into their own careers in computer science. Watching their success, ultimately
        inspired me to join Epicodus & I’m excited to utilize the skills I’ve gathered through my career, as I
        transition into this new field!

        Outside of work and school, I’ve been loving cooking lately! My best recipes have been Indian - biryani,
        tandoori, & any type of curry. Although my goal this fall is to dive more into baking. I also love biking
        around town & traveling. I’ve been all throughout Thailand, as well as several countries In Europe. I’m
        hoping to get back to Europe soon!
