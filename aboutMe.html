        About Me..
    </h2>
    <div class="box1">
        <p>
            I have a career background in sales and retail management. I spent about seven years in retail- five of
            which were spent working for Nordstrom. I began at Nordstrom as a sales associate, and quickly realized
            how much I enjoyed the dynamic, creative, and often fast-paced nature of working retail.

            At Nordstrom, I moved up into various management positions where I developed my leadership, organization,
            and problem-solving skills. Retail management was an especially fun space to work in, as every day presented
            new & interesting challenges to tackle. Needless to say, I quickly developed the skills needed to navigate
            that sort of fast-paced & dynamic work environment. In short, my time with Nordstrom gave me the opportunity
            & skills necessary to manage a team, handle logistics, & effectively tackle the always-evolving challenges
            of a retail space.

            Before ever moving into my retail career, I did complete some college education. However at the time, I
            wasn’t quite clear on which path I wanted to take. It was towards the end of my retail career that I began
            exploring an interest in computer science. I had watched 2 of my brothers successfully complete Epicodus &
            shortly after, they moved into their own careers in computer science. Watching their success, ultimately
            inspired me to join Epicodus & I’m excited to utilize the skills I’ve gathered through my career, as I
            transition into this new field!

            Outside of work and school, I’ve been loving cooking lately! My best recipes have been Indian - biryani,
            tandoori, & any type of curry. Although my goal this fall is to dive more into baking. I also love biking
            around town & traveling. I’ve been all throughout Thailand, as well as several countries In Europe. I’m
            hoping to get back to Europe soon!
